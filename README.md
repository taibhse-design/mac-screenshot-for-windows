# mac-screenshot-for-windows
allows quick screenshots and crops like a mac,  hold mouse at start point for screenshot, press and hold ctrl+shift+s and move mouse to end point of screenshot,  release held buttons, screenshot will save.

After seeing my boss take quick screenshots on a mac, I wanted this feature for windows, the closest was the clipping tool which is clumsy to use, so instead this was developed. This read me will be updated as the program progresses.
